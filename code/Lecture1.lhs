--Exercise 1.1: Programming systems (even Haskell) perform according to their definitions, which don't always conform to our naive expectations. Consider the following sequence:

--         > let f x = 0
--         > let g x = f x
--         > let f x = 1
--         > g 0

-- Explain why the result of this evaluation is 0, and not 1.

-- Answer: In haskell values are bound to symbols. 
-- These values are immutable. The only way to make a symbol (or function
-- in our case) mean something else is to bind it to a different value.
-- In this case f x is bound to 0. While f x is bound to 0 it is assigned
-- to g x. Therefore, g x has been bound to 0. Even if we assign f x
-- equal to 1 this means that the value bound to f x has changed, but not the
-- value bound to g x.


-- Exercise 1.2: The law of cosines is a generalization of the Pythagorean Theorem, which allows us to compute the length c of the third side of a triangle, given the lengths of the two other sides a and b, and the included angle Î³.
